    <div id="overflowTest">"Learning to code is like solving a puzzle. Each piece, whether it’s
        HTML, CSS, or JavaScript connect to build a complete picture. With
        consistent practice and curiosity, anyone can create something amazing.
        Start small, but dream big, and remember, every expert was once a
        beginner."

        creativity and solving real-world problems. By understanding the
        building blocks of programming, you gain the power to turn ideas into
        reality. Stay persistent, embrace challenges, and celebrate each
        milestone as you grow into a confident and capable coder.</div>
